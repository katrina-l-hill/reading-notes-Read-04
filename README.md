Wireframes:

- A wireframe is a way to design a website by having you think through what you want it to look like, then draft it with pencil and paper, then draw it in a digitl program.
- The point of drafting the website design on paper is so you can get a rough idea of what it will look like without being bogged down with too many specifics.
- By drafting the design on pencil and paper, you can play around with the location of the logo, graphics, text boxes, etc., before you digitize the design.
- The specifics will come later when you start coding the website.

HTML:

- HTML stands for Hypertect Markup Language.
- It defines the way a website is structured and how it's content is presented (e.g.,paragraphs, lists, images, and tables)
- HTML is comprised of _elements_ which are used to make content appear a specific way.

MDN:

- This site is a great HTML website resource.
- It describes what HTML is and provides a many key resources for understanding HTML and elements.

Semantics:

- This refers to the meaning of code.
- Essentially, it helps you to understand why a piece of code does what it does, looks the way it does, and its purpose.
- Semantics helps demonstrate an action for what the code is doing.

I've learned there is a lot to learn about coding. At this point in my journey, it's a little easy to mix up Markdown and HTML tags, but with time I'll get them straight. The semantics that make up the coding language are exhaustive and complex, but interesting and fun.
